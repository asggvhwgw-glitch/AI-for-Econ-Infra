# Unified execution planner

The execution planner is an estimator-agnostic layer between **econometric correctness** and **physical execution**. It does not infer coefficients, samples, fixed effects, instruments, separation, or covariance formulas.

Its invariant is:

```text
exactness / eligibility certificate
              ↓
resource and cost comparison
              ↓
real-runtime calibration where appropriate
              ↓
physical execution choice
```

A candidate that lacks an exact certificate is never allowed to win because it is faster or smaller.

## Current scope

The planner now unifies four execution responsibilities that were previously distributed across modules:

1. **Memory envelope.** Data ingestion and HDFE workspaces use the same user-budget + runtime-headroom policy.
2. **Representation.** Dense and block-dense design paths express exact eligibility through the shared certificate contract. The established conservative one-shot/repeated-pass production policy remains in place because storage-byte savings alone do not predict wall time reliably.
3. **Parallel budget.** Outer/inner workers share one non-oversubscribed CPU budget.
4. **Real-runtime automatic thread calibration.** On the first sufficiently large HDFE workload (currently 100k+ observations), `threads="auto"` runs a short deterministic synthetic memory-bound Numba probe at candidate thread counts, selects the smallest candidate within 5% of the measured best median time, and caches that decision by an anonymous runtime fingerprint. Smaller HDFE workloads stay single-threaded so calibration and parallel overhead cannot dominate the fit.

Explicit integer thread counts always override calibration. Calibration controls only execution resources; it cannot change the model, sample, FE, instruments, weights, clustering, covariance formula, or convergence criterion.

## Why calibration is deliberately bounded

Thread scaling for HDFE is usually memory-bandwidth limited. The maximum logical CPU count is therefore not a reliable default. At the same time, microbenchmarks are noisy and cannot guarantee the exact optimum for every topology/operator mix. The auto policy is consequently designed to find a **stable near-saturation region**, not to promise the globally fastest thread count for every regression.

The canonical validation is an alternating multi-round comparison of the calibrated `auto` choice against explicit candidate thread counts on an unchanged synthetic HDFE workload. A machine-specific anomaly is reportable through the planner developer-report mechanism rather than hidden by a benchmark-specific hard-coded threshold.

Calibration state is disposable. Removing the local planner cache can only cause a future recalibration; it cannot change econometric semantics.

## Planner developer feedback

`econhdfe.planner.write_planner_developer_report(...)` and `skills/econhdfe/scripts/planner_report.py` generate a privacy-minimized Markdown/JSON report containing only:

- aggregate runtime CPU/memory capability;
- anonymous calibration ID and candidate timing curve;
- selected thread budget and optional execution-plan metadata;
- anonymous workload counts and aggregate timing/iteration counters when a result is supplied.

The report contains no raw/sampled/synthetic observations, variable identifiers, confidential paths, exact commands/scripts, hostnames, raw logs, full tracebacks, or source data. Nothing is transmitted automatically. Real-data performance benchmarking remains a separate explicit-consent workflow.

The canonical fill-in template is `docs/development/PLANNER_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` and is mirrored in the standalone skill.

## Why the representation byte-cost model remains advisory

A compact representation reduces memory traffic, but dense BLAS may still win on a one-shot contiguous operation because of vectorization and dispatch overhead. Development microbenchmarks show exactly this at moderate structural sparsity. Therefore the generic byte-traffic model remains an explainable comparison primitive; it does **not** replace the conservative production representation policy solely from structural-zero ratios.

## Dependency boundary

```text
data ───────┐
compute ────┼──► planner
hdfe ───────┘

planner ─X─► data / compute / hdfe / iv / models
```

`planner.calibration` benchmarks only package-generated synthetic memory traffic and imports no HDFE/model implementation. HDFE consumes the selected thread budget. `planner.report` consumes only contracts/aggregate result metadata and likewise does not define estimation logic.

`planner.resources` remains the canonical runtime-resource contract. `compute.runtime` is a compatibility surface that re-exports it.

## Non-goals

- no ML planner;
- no remote telemetry or automatic report upload;
- no persistent database of user workload performance;
- no estimator-specific planner logic;
- no dynamic changes to the econometric specification;
- no default change to dense/block representation thresholds based only on byte savings.
